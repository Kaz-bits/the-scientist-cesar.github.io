## Bio

I am currently pursuing a Master of Science degree at Sosa's laboratory at the School of Medicine, which is associated with the physicochemistry and protein engineering laboratory at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.

I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree at the School of Chemistry at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.

I am currently an entrepreneur seeking to establish a new start-up focused on the teaching of artificial intelligence algorithms in educational institutions.

## Research interests

-   **Protein design:** exploration in the intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) universe to study their physicochemical properties and design new biosensors for tracking the intracellualr environment.

-   **Fluorescence techniques:** Utilizing the FRET technique for asking if disorder proteins reacts with chemical environment shifts.

-   **Computational analysis:** in silico analysis and programming using Python, R, and bash, to answer questions about which combination of molecular properties allows to design intrinsically disordered regions with a high structural sensitivity to a hyperosmotic environment.

-   **Artificial intelligence:** computational characterization of physicochemical protein properties based on artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms.

## Teaching

I dedicate time to teaching programming languages like Python, R, and Bash to young scientists and the public. Since 2019, I have been passionate about working towards establishing a startup focused on teaching programming languages within the scientific community, aiming to empower individuals with valuable coding skills.

## Personal life

I am engaged in scientific outreach at science museums in Mexico City, and scientific dissemination in museums of science in the city of Mexico I communicate astronomy topics to diverse audiences, fostering science appreciation among children, young adults, and the elderly.

Beyond academia, my entrepreneurial vision is leveraging artificial intelligence algorithms to enhance global scientific endeavors. In my leisure time, I immerse myself in video games, using them to explore historical events. Exploring the city aimlessly is a cherished pastime, allowing me to appreciate the beauty of my surroundings without a predetermined destination.
